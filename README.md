## Description
This workshop will cover how to use [jsPsych version 8.1.0](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/releases/tag/jspsych%408.1.0) to build psychological experiments. jsPsych is a free, open-source software that employs a JavaScript framework for creating behavioral experiments that run in a web browser. It's a popular alternative to PsychoPy and E-Prime for task development, is used primarily in behavioral tasks, and supports online study capabilities.
