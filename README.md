12/17/2024

__**Content creator:**__ Steven Martinez

## Description
This workshop will cover how to use [jsPsych version 8.1.0](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/releases/tag/jspsych%408.1.0) to build psychological experiments. jsPsych is a free, open-source software that employs a JavaScript framework for creating behavioral experiments that run in a web browser. It's a popular alternative to PsychoPy and E-Prime for task development, is used primarily in behavioral tasks, and supports online study capabilities.  

## Set Up (do before the workshop)

1. Download Visual Studio Code, which is a programming-friendly text editor that works with Windows, OSX/Mac, and Linux, and can be downloaded at the following link:  https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

2. Download the latest release of jsPsych, which as of now is jsPsych 8.1.0. The jsPsych software is a set of files located in the jspsych/dist folder.

3. Download the 'AIDI-jsPsych' folder from the Github page. This folder contains the following items: 1) the jsPsych software, which is essentially a set of files located in the *jsPsych/dist* folder; 2) the stimuli folder, which has the stimuli that we will use for this workshop; and 3) the index.html file, which is the full version of the experiment that we will build today.
